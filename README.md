## Embedding Cyclical Information in Solar Irradiance Forecasting

With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the codes required to produce the results in the manuscript:

> T. A. Fathima, V. Nedumpozhimana, Y. H. Lee, and S. Dev, Embedding Cyclical Information in Solar Irradiance Forecasting, *under review*.

### Executive summary
In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of embedding temporal information for an accurate prediction of solar irradiance.

### Code
The code is written in `python3`.
+ `forecast.py`: Computes the performance of our proposed forecasting model.

### Datasets
As the dataset is privately owned, therefore we cannot release the dataset `PWV_2010from_WS_2_withGradient.mat` file in this repository.
